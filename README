Description
--------------------
A hopefully soon to be series of Munin plugins for displaying Twilio data via Munin


Dependencies
--------------------
BeautifulSoup - http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
python-munin - http://github.com/samuel/python-munin
Twill - http://twill.idyll.org/


Usage
--------------------
1) Copy the plugin(s) to your Munin plugins directory
2) Modify the plugin to use your e-mail and password for Twilio login
3) Modify your Munin plugin config file to include the plugin
4) Restart munin-node


Notes
--------------------
- twilio-balance requires username/password because you can't get your balance via API calls


Thoughts
--------------------
- Defaulting from 0 -> 500 right now for balance, this may need to change
